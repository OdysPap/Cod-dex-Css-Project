            <h2 id="about"><u>About Me</u></h2><br>
            <p>I'm a computer science student with a passion for web development and design. I enjoy creating interactive and user-friendly websites.<br>
            I finished my bachelor in Physics in the University of Bourgogne and I am currently looking to start my career in computer science.<br>
            I'm 25 years old and I am from Greece/France. I love movies and playing video games in my free time, but my favourite hobby is going<br>
            to the gym and BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu). I'm also a big fan of series. I recently finished a series called Snowfall and was sad about the ending.</p>

            <h2 id="work"><u>Work Experience</u></h2><br>
            <p>From the age of 18, I started working in a restaurant as a waiter. I worked there for 3 years and I learned a lot<br>
                about customer service and teamwork. After that, i worked as a data analyst for an<br>
                E-sports team in Norway (Riddle Esports). I was responsible for collecting and analyzing data from our players<br>
                and the opposing teams. I also created reports and presentations to help our coaches make better decisions.<br>
                I spent the last year working as a receptionnist in a 3-star hotel (<a href="https://all.accor.com/hotel/B7R6/index.fr.shtml" target="_blank">click me</a>) in France. I was responsible for<br>
                checking in and checking out guests, answering phone calls and emails, and managing reservations.<br>
                I also helped with the organization of events and conferences in the hotel.<br>
                I am currently looking for a web developer internship to gain more experience in the field and to learn new skills.</p><br><br>
            <p>I knew that I wanted to work in the IT field so I started learning about web development after quitting from the hotel.
                I started with HTML and CSS, then I learned JavaScript and React. My goal is to add numerous skills and projects<br>
                to my CV in order to become a more complete web developer. Coursera, CodeAcademy and (of course) <u>Codédex</u> are some websites that <br>
                help me with my learning.
            </p><br>
            <p>I find it also important to note that I've been through a lot of interviews either for work or studies.
                I have been accepted to a couple of programs and more recently i was accepter to a 3 year master's program in computer science<br>
                in the University of Epitech. Ideally, I would like to start an internship(alternance here in france).
